# Unshakable Facts: Ownership Under Pressure
**Because doing the right thing isn’t just our culture — it’s our promise.**

---

## Program Purpose
When situations get uncomfortable—comebacks, safety concerns, customer frustration, internal mistakes—our job is not to hide, guess, blame, or delay. Our job is to lead with facts, ownership, and clear next actions so we protect the customer, protect the team, and protect the business.  
This program builds one shared language across the dealership so every department responds the same way under pressure.

## What This Program Solves
1) **Deflection / blame loops**  
2) **Silence / avoidance**  
3) **“All I got was a bill” communication failures**  
4) **Weak documentation**  
5) **Leaders who don’t confront issues early**  
6) **Customer trust damage from inconsistent messaging**

# Part A — Core System (Shared Language)

## Module 1 — The Unshakable Facts Standard
**Goal:** Install one shared standard for how we behave when things get uncomfortable.  
**Audience:** All staff  
**Time:** 30–45 minutes

### Facilitator Script (word-for-word)
**Opening (read verbatim):**  
“Team, uncomfortable situations are not the problem.  
The problem is how we respond when it gets uncomfortable.

When pressure hits, people default to emotion, assumptions, and deflection.  
That’s how small issues become big problems.

Starting today, we use one operating system: **Unshakable Facts.**”

**Teach (read verbatim):**  
“Unshakable Facts are the antidote to emotion and blame.  
They are **verifiable truths + documented evidence + clear next action.**  
Not opinions. Not assumptions. Not ‘I think.’”

**Close (read verbatim):**  
“From now on, when it gets uncomfortable, we don’t argue.  
We verify. We document. We own the outcome. We communicate timing.”

---

## Module 2 — Definitions (Shared Language)
**Goal:** Give the store one shared language.  
**Audience:** All staff  
**Time:** 25–35 minutes

### Facilitator Script (word-for-word)
**Read verbatim:**  
“Unshakable Facts = verifiable truth + documented evidence + clear next action.  
Ownership is not the same as fault. Ownership means we take responsibility for **verification, communication, customer outcome, and process correction.**  
Deflection is pushing responsibility away **before** facts are verified and documented.  
Verification is how we turn a story into truth.  
Communication cadence means nobody is left guessing. Timing is part of professionalism.”

### Quick Drill (5 minutes)
Ask: “Is this a fact or an assumption?”
- “Customer said the wheel almost came off.” → **fact** (customer statement)  
- “Another shop caused it.” → **assumption** until verified  
- “Torque verified to spec and documented.” → **fact**

---

## Module 3 — Non-Negotiables (Standards We Enforce)
**Goal:** Define rules we enforce consistently.  
**Audience:** All staff

2) “No blame language until facts are verified.”  
3) “Safety triggers an elevated response.”  
4) “Next update time is mandatory.”  
5) “Documentation is the process.”  
6) “We protect trust while we verify.”

**Close (verbatim):**  
“If it’s not documented, it didn’t happen. If there’s no next update time, we are not in control.”

---

## Module 4 — 2–2–2 Updates (The Only Update Format)
**Goal:** Install the universal update format.  
**Audience:** All staff  
**Time:** 25–35 minutes

### Facilitator Script (word-for-word)
**Read verbatim:**  
“Every update—customer or internal—includes:  
**2 facts. 2 actions. 2 times.**  
No exceptions.”

**Example (verbatim):**  
“Facts: We verified ___. We found ___.  
Actions: We are doing ___. Next we are doing ___.  
Times: ETA is ___. Next update will be at ___.”

**Rule (verbatim):**  
“No one should ever say: ‘All I got was a bill.’”

---

## Module 5 — Deflection → Ownership Rewrites
**Goal:** Train people to replace defensive language with ownership language.  
**Audience:** All staff

- “That wasn’t us.”  
  → “Here’s what we verified, what we haven’t verified yet, and what we’re doing next.”

- “Another shop did it.”  
  → “Even if that contributed, we still own verification before release and customer outcome.”

- “We didn’t touch it.”  
  → “Here’s what we verified, here’s the proof, and here’s the plan.”

- “Used cars… things happen.”  
  → “One issue can happen. Repeats mean we close the process gap.”

“When safety is involved, the process changes immediately.
